# Wine Dataset Machine Learning in R
## Introduction
This project is a machine learning project in R that aims to analyze and predict wine quality based on various features using the Wine Quality dataset. The dataset contains information about various attributes of wine, such as acidity, alcohol content, and quality ratings.

## Dataset
The Wine Quality dataset (winequality.csv) is included in the project folder. This dataset contains the following columns:

- fixed acidity
- volatile acidity
- citric acid
- residual sugar
- chlorides
- free sulfur dioxide
- total sulfur dioxide
- density
- pH
- sulphates
- alcohol
- quality (target variable)

## Usage
1. Open the R script (wine_quality_prediction.R) in RStudio.
2. Modify the script as needed, such as data preprocessing, feature selection, and model tuning.
3. Run the script to train and evaluate machine learning models for wine quality prediction.

## Models
We have implemented and evaluated the following machine learning models:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

You can choose to use any of these models for your wine quality prediction task. Model performance metrics are reported in the script.

## Results
The results of model evaluation and wine quality predictions can be found in the script output and are explained in the comments within the script.
